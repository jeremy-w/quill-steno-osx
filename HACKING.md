# Hacking on Quill
Welcome! We're excited you're interested in contributing.
This document will help you get off to a good start.

## Setup
- Clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/jeremy-w/quill-steno-osx.git

- Change directory to the repository root and run `./bootstrap.sh`
  to install required development tools

      cd quill-steno-osx && ./bootstrap.sh

- Pick a problem to work on and create a solution.
- Open a pull request referencing the problem and describing how you've
  solved it.


## Style
- When you add a new file,
  replace Xcode's default top-of-file comment spew
  with the mercifully briefer text:

  ```

  ```
