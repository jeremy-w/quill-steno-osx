# Quill: OS X Native, Free & Libre Steno Software
Quill is an implementation of
the [Open Steno Project's](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover)
[Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover)
stenotype software.

Whereas Plover uses wxWidgets via wxPython
in order to provide identical support across all of Windows, Linux, and OS X,
Quill uses the technologies native to OS X to deliver the best possible
user experience on that platform.
